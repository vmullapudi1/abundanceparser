#IMPORTANT: Use string literals instead of strings to allow escape characters
#to function properly.
#Regex Strings should be formatted with single quotes (e.g. 'foobar') or triple
#quotes (e.g. '''this is a string literal as well''') to store them as string
#literals

#looks for a open square braket, 1 or more digits (capturing group), a dash, 1 or more digits (capturing group)
# and a closing bracket. The capturing groups capture the digits so we can use them to localize the peptide fragment.
regex.pos_master_regex = '\[([\d]{1,})\-([\d]{1,})\]'

#matches serine, threonine,tyrosine, followed by 0 or more digits in a capturing group
#the captured digits are used to localize the modification
# WARNING- any modifications tos erine, threonine, and tyrosine are picked up by this

# TODO implement
