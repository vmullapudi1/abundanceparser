title="Perser Regex Configuration"
#IMPORTANT: Use string literals instead of strings to allow escape characters
#to function properly.
#Regex Strings should be formatted with single quotes (e.g. 'foobar') or triple
#quotes (e.g. '''this is a string literal as well''') to store them as string
#literals
